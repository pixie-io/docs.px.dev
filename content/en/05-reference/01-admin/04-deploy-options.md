## Labeling Pixie's Resources

When deploying Pixie using the CLI, you have the option of adding one or more custom [labels](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/) to the K8s objects deployed by Pixie.

``` bash
# Deploy the Pixie Platform in your K8s cluster and give the deployed objects label(s)
px deploy --labels=key1=value1,key2=value2

# Example deployment with labeling:
px deploy --labels=application=pixie
```

Certain labels are reserved for internal use by Pixie. The following are reserved label strings that may _**not be**_ used:

- `"vizier-bootstrap"`
- `“component"`
- `“vizier-updater-dep"`
- `“app"`

## PEM Memory Usage

Pixie deploys its PEMs as a DaemonSet on your cluster in order to collect and store telemetry data. The default memory limit is 2Gi per PEM. The lowest recommended value is [1Gi](/installing-pixie/requirements/#memory) per PEM. You have the option to configure this value via the `--pem_memory_limit` flag in the CLI/YAML (`--set pemMemoryLimit=<limit>` in Helm).

## Data Access

You can configure Pixie's data access mode in order to control what data can be displayed when executing a script.
Pixie offers two modes:

1. `Full` (default): The user has full data access, and Pixie does not redact any collected data from the user during script execution.
2. `Restricted`: The user has restricted data access. Pixie will redact all columns that may potentially contain sensitive data (e.g. request/response bodies and headers). All rows in the column will be redacted, regardless of whether they do or do not actually contain PII.  Metadata about these columns, such as length, will still be queryable.

### CLI/YAML Install

You may specify the desired data access mode using the `--data_access` flag. If no mode is specified, the deploy assumes `Full` as default.

```
px deploy --data_access=(Full|Restricted)
```

### Helm Install

You may specify the desired data access mode using the `dataAccess` field.

```
helm install pixie pixie-operator/pixie-operator-chart --set deployKey=<deploy-key-goes-here> --set clusterName=<cluster-name> --namespace pl --create-namespace
--dataAccess=(Full|Restricted)
```

You may also directly update the `dataAccess` field in your `values.yaml` file.
