Deploy keys allow Pixie's Cloud to associate a cluster with an organization.

When deploying Pixie onto a cluster [using the CLI](/installing-pixie/install-schemes/cli/), a deploy key is automatically created behind the scenes. When deploying with [YAML](/installing-pixie/install-schemes/yaml/) or [Helm](/installing-pixie/install-schemes/helm/), you will need to manually create a deploy key for use in the deployment process.

A deploy key can be used to install Pixie on any number of clusters. If you are installing in a cluster previously seen by Pixie, the install merges the history with the previous version in Pixie.

## Create a Deploy Key

You can create a deploy key using either the CLI or Live UI.

### Using the CLI

In the terminal, run

```bash
px deploy-key create
```

Copy the output value labeled `Key`:
