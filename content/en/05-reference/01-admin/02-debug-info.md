Pixie automatically traces requests of a variety of protocol types. A subset of the supported protocols and encryption libraries require debug information to work with Pixie.

## Checking for debug symbols

You can verify that an executable has debug symbols using `nm`:

```bash
nm <executable>
```

An output of `no symbols` means the application has no debug symbols and won't be traced.

## Checking for DWARF debug information

You can verify that an executable has DWARF debug information using `dwarfdump` or `llvm-dwarfdump`:

```bash
dwarfdump <executable>

```

An output of `No DWARF information present` means the application has no DWARF debug information, and won't be traced.

## Adding debug information to your Golang executable

By default, `go build` compiles your program with debug information. However, if you compile with `-ldflags`, make sure to remove the `'-s'` and `'-w'`.
