Below are the requirements for deploying Pixie to your Kubernetes (K8s) cluster.

Please refer to the [install guides](/installing-pixie/install-guides/) for information on how to install Pixie to your K8s cluster.

## Kubernetes

Kubernetes `v1.16+` is required.

### Production Environments

| K8s Environment  | Support                                                         |
| :--------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AKS              | Supported                                                       |
| EKS              | Supported (includes support on Bottlerocket AMIs)               |
| EKS Fargate      | Not Supported ([Fargate does not support eBPF](https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap/issues/1027)) |
| GKE              | Supported                                                       |
| GKE Autopilot    | Not Supported ([Autopilot does not support eBPF](https://github.com/pixie-io/pixie/issues/278#issuecomment-853269290)) |
| OKE              | Supported                                                       |
| OpenShift        | Supported                                                       |
| kOps             | Supported                                                       |
| Self-hosted      | Generally supported, see requirements below including Linux kernel version. |

### Local Development Environments

For local development, we recommend using Minikube with a VM driver (`kvm2` on Linux, `hyperkit` on Mac). Note that Kubernetes environments that run inside a container are not currently supported.

| K8s Environment                 | Support       |
| :------------------------------ | :------------ |
| Docker Desktop                  | Not supported |
| k0s                             | Supported     |
| k3s                             | Supported     |
| k3d                             | Not Supported ([k3d runs k3s clusters inside Docker container "nodes"](https://github.com/pixie-io/pixie/issues/337#issuecomment-949012061)) |
| kind                            | Not Supported ([kind runs K8s clusters inside Docker container "nodes"](https://github.com/pixie-io/pixie/issues/337#issuecomment-949012061)) |
| minikube with `driver=kvm2`     | Supported     |
| minikube with `driver=hyperkit` | Supported     |
| minikube with `driver=docker`   | Not Supported |
| minikube with `driver=none`     | Not Supported |

## Memory

Pixie requires the following memory per node:

| Minimum   | Notes                                                                  |
| :-------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1GiB      | To accommodate application pods, we recommend using no more than 25% of the nodes' total memory for Pixie.  |

Pixie deploys its PEMs as a DaemonSet on your cluster in order to collect and store telemetry data. The default memory limit is 2Gi per PEM. The lowest recommended value is 1Gi per PEM. For more information on how to configure Pixie's memory usage, see the [Tuning Memory Usage](/reference/admin/tuning-mem-usage/) page.

## CPU

Pixie requires an `x86-64` architecture.

|         | Support           |
| :------ | :---------------- |
| x86-64  | Supported         |
| ARM     | Not supported     |

## Operating System

Pixie runs on Linux nodes only.

|         | Support         | Version           |
| :------ | :-------------  | :---------------- |
| Linux   | Supported       | v4.14+            |
| Windows | Not Supported   | Not in roadmap    |

### Linux Distributions

The following is a list of Linux distributions that have been tested.

|              |  Version              |
|:-----------  |  :------------------- |
| Ubuntu       |  18.04+               |
| Debian       |  10+                  |
| RHEL         |  8+                   |
| CentOS       |  7.3+                  |

Pixie may also work on other distributions.

<Alert variant="outlined" severity="info">We recommended that Linux headers be installed on a cluster's nodes.</Alert>

## Network Traffic

Pixie's [Vizier](/reference/architecture/#vizier) module sends outgoing HTTPS/2 requests to Pixie's [Cloud](/reference/architecture/#cloud) on port `443`.

Your cluster's telemetry data flows through Pixie's Cloud via a reverse proxy as encrypted traffic without any persistence. This allows users to access data without being in the same VPC/network as the cluster. Pixie offers [end-to-end encryption](/about-pixie/faq#data-collection-how-does-pixie-secure-its-data) for telemetry data in flight.
