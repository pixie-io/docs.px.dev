Get Pixie fully managed with [Pixie Community Cloud](/installing-pixie/install-guides/community-cloud-for-pixie) (free forever) or run on your own infrastructure with the following self-managed option.

## Prerequisites

- Review Pixie's [requirements](/installing-pixie/requirements) to make sure that your Kubernetes cluster is supported.

- Determine if you already have [Operator Lifecycle Manager](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.5/operators/understanding/olm/olm-understanding-olm.html) (OLM) deployed to your cluster, possibly to the default `olm` namespace. Pixie uses the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) to manage its Vizier, which handles data collection and query execution (see the [Architecture](/about-pixie/what-is-pixie/#system-architecture) diagram). The OLM is used to install, update and manage the Vizier Operator.

- Ensure that your cluster supports Pixie creating and using [PersistentVolumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/).

## 1. Deploy Pixie Cloud

<Alert variant="outlined" severity="info">
  Pixie also offers a free account with Pixie Community Cloud to make getting started even easier and faster. To get Pixie Cloud, check out the community cloud <a href="https://docs.pixielabs.ai/installing-pixie/install-guides/community-cloud-for-pixie">quick start guide</a>.
</Alert>

<Alert variant="outlined" severity="info">
  Self-managed Pixie Cloud has been tested on GKE only.
</Alert>

<Alert variant="outlined" severity="warning">
  There is a known issue with login on self-managed Pixie Cloud on Safari and Firefox. For now, use Chrome.
</Alert>

1. Clone the [Pixie repo](https://github.com/pixie-labs/pixie).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pixie-labs/pixie.git
cd pixie
```

2. Install `mkcert` following the directions [here](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert#installation). Pixie uses SSL to securely communicate between Pixie Cloud and the UI. Self-managed Pixie Cloud requires managing your own certificates. `mkcert` is a simple tool to create and install a local certificate authority (CA) in the system root store in order to generate locally-trusted certificates.

3. Start `mkcert`. This command will set up local CA and create a root certificate that Chrome and your CLI will now trust. To access Pixie Cloud from different machine that the one it was set up on, you will need to install this certificate there as well.

```bash
mkcert -install
```

4. Create the `plc` namespace. This namespace is not currently configurable. Several of the install scripts expect Pixie Cloud to be deployed to the `plc` namespace.

```bash
kubectl create namespace plc
```

5. Create the Pixie Cloud secrets. From the top level `pixie/` directory, run:

```bash
./scripts/create_cloud_secrets.sh
```

6. Install `kustomize` following the directions [here](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/installation/kustomize/).

7. Deploy Pixie Cloud dependencies and wait for all pods within the `plc` namespace to become ready and available before proceeding to the next step.

```bash
kustomize build k8s/cloud_deps/public/ | kubectl apply -f - --namespace=plc
```

8. Deploy Pixie Cloud.

```bash
kustomize build k8s/cloud/public/ | kubectl apply -f - --namespace=plc
```

9. Wait for all pods within the `plc` namespace to become ready and available. Note that you may have one or more create-hydra-client-job pod errors, but as long as long as another instance of that pod successfully completes, that is ok.

```bash
kubectl get pods -n plc
```

### Set up DNS

1. Setup your DNS. This produces a `dev_dns_updater` binary in the top level `pixie` directory.

```bash
go build src/utils/dev_dns_updater/dev_dns_updater.go
```

2. You'll need to hardcode in your kube config. Leave this tab open.

```bash
./dev_dns_updater --domain-name="dev.withpixie.dev"  --kubeconfig=$HOME/.kube/config --n=plc
```

3. Navigate to `dev.withpixie.dev` in your browser. Make sure that the network you are on can access your cluster.

### Authentication using Kratos / Hydra

Self-managed Pixie Cloud only supports one organization.

1. To setup the default admin account, check the logs for the `create-admin-job` pod by running:

```bash
kubectl log create-admin-job-<pod_string> -n plc
```

2. Open the URL from the pod's logs to set the password for the `admin@default.com` user.

<Alert variant="outlined" severity="warning">
  If you've visited dev.withpixie.dev before, make sure to clear the cookies for this site or you'll get a login error. 
</Alert>

3. Once the password has been set, login using `admin@default.com` for the `identifier` and your new password.

<Alert variant="outlined" severity="warning">
  There is a known issue with login on self-managed Pixie Cloud on Safari and Firefox. For now, use Chrome.
</Alert>

### Invite others to your organization (optional)

1. Navigate to `dev.withpixie.dev/admin/invite` in your browser. Fill out the necessary information to send invite links to anyone who you'd like to share access with. Note that this link expires after a certain amount of time and cannot be recreated for the expired email address.

## 2. Install the Pixie CLI

1. Set the cloud address with an environment variable:

```bash
export PL_CLOUD_ADDR=dev.withpixie.dev
```

2. Install Pixie's CLI

The easiest way to install Pixie's CLI is using the install script:

``` bash
# Copy and run command to install the Pixie CLI.
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://withpixie.ai/install.sh)"
```

For alternate install options (Docker, Debian package, RPM, direct download of the binary) see the [CLI Install](/installing-pixie/install-schemes/cli/) page.

## 3. Deploy Pixie ðŸš€

Pixie's CLI is the fastest and easiest way to deploy Pixie. You can also deploy Pixie using [YAML](/installing-pixie/install-schemes/yaml) or [Helm](/installing-pixie/install-schemes/helm).

To deploy Pixie using the CLI:

<Alert variant="outlined" severity="info">
  If your cluster already has Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) deployed, deploy Pixie using the `--deploy_olm=false` flag.
</Alert>

``` bash
# List Pixie deployment options.
px deploy --help

# Deploy the Pixie Platform in your K8s cluster (No OLM present on cluster).
px deploy --dev_cloud_namespace plc

# Deploy the Pixie Platform in your K8s cluster (OLM already exists on cluster).
px deploy  --dev_cloud_namespace plc --deploy_olm=false
```

Pixie will deploy pods to the `pl`, `plc`, `px-operator`, and `olm`(if deploying the OLM) namespaces.

## 4. Use Pixie

### Deploy a demo microservices app (optional)

Deploy a simple demo app to monitor using Pixie:

```bash
# List available demo apps.
px demo list

# Example: deploy Weaveworks' "sock-shop".
px demo deploy px-sock-shop
```

This demo application takes several minutes to stabilize after deployment.

To check the status of the application's pods, run:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n px-sock-shop
```

### Test out the CLI

Use `px run` to run a script to demonstrate observability. The `demo_script` script shows the latency and request path of http traffic hitting your cluster.

``` bash
# List built-in scripts
px scripts list

# Run a script
px run px/demo_script
```

For more information, checkout our [CLI guide](/using-pixie/using-cli/).

### Explore the web app

Open [Pixie's Live UI](https://work.dev.withpixie.dev:443) in a new tab.

1. Select your cluster.
3. Now, select a script (e.g. `px/cluster` or `px/http_data`).

For more information, check out our [Live UI guide](/using-pixie/using-live-ui/).
