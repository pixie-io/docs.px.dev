You can interact with Pixie's no-instrumentation observability platform by using the web based Live UI, CLI or API. These clients use [PxL Scripts](/reference/pxl-overview) to query telemetry data collected by the Pixie Platform.

- [Using the Live UI](/using-pixie/using-live-ui)
- [Using the CLI](/using-pixie/using-cli)
- [Using the API](/using-pixie/api-quick-start)

Pixie gives you instant visibility to metrics, events, and traces without changing code. Use Pixie to:

- [Monitor Service Health](/using-pixie/use-cases/service-health)
- [Monitor Infra Health](/using-pixie/use-cases/infra-health)
- [Monitor Database Health](/using-pixie/use-cases/db-health)
- [Trace Network Requests](/using-pixie/use-cases/request-tracing)
- [Debug Production Code](/using-pixie/use-cases/code-tracing)
- [Monitor Canary Builds](/using-pixie/use-cases/canary-analysis)
