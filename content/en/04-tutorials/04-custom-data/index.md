Scripts written using the [Pixie Language](/reference/pxl) (PxL) can both:

1. Query [telemetry data](/about-pixie/data-sources) collected by the Pixie Platform (DNS events, HTTP events, etc).
2. Extend Pixie to collect new data sources (in addition to those it collects by default).

The following tutorials show how to write scripts that extend Pixie to collect new data sources:

- [Distributed bpftrace Deployment](/tutorials/custom-data/distributed-bpftrace-deployment)
- [Dynamic Logging in Go](/tutorials/custom-data/dynamic-go-logging/)
