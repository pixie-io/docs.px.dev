### Dev Setup

To run in development mode, run the following commands:

```shell
yarn install
yarn start
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000/` to view the app.

To generate a production build, run:

```shell
yarn install
yarn build
```

### Adding New Language Translations

1. Create a new empty folder in the `content` folder. Name the folder with the new language's [2-letter code](https://quicksilvertranslate.com/712/iso6392-letterlanguagecodes/).
2. Add a new item for the new language to the `languages` list in the `available-languages.js` file.
3. Copy the file you want to translate from the `en` folder into the new folder. Make sure to maintain the same folder structure, folder names, and file name as the `en` directory.
4. Translate the file and create a PR.

### Updating Automated Content

To pull the latest reference docs, run:

```shell
./update_docs.sh
```

This will overwrite `external/pxl_documentation.json`.
Add the changed file to the repo and submit a pull request.

### Deploy Previews

Once you submit a pull request to this repo, Netlify creates a [deploy preview](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/07/20/introducing-deploy-previews-in-netlify/) for the changes in the specific PR. You can view the deploy preview in the Netlify panel that appears under the PR description.

### Publishing the Site

The Pixie website is published automatically by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Whenever changes are merged into the `prod` branch, Netlify re-builds and re-deploys the site.
